INTRODUCTION

  UDTGATE is a set of application for high-performance transport
  tunnels to efficiently manage intensive data streams between
  interacting sites.

  UDTGATE is primarily uses UDT package: a powerful highly
  configurable udt-based user-level network transport suite which can
  efficiently manage network links with high bandwidth*delay factors
  and other "anomales" where basic TCP looses.

  Currently UDTGATE package includes two applications:

    * udtgate (planing for 2.x release) - solution to establish OSI L4 overlay
    networks with possibility to transparently route clients's network
    connection through several intermediate L4 gateways interacting
    with each other with UDT protocol.

    and

    * udtrelay - lightweight proxy allowing to pass TCP connections
    between two sites over UDT tunnel. 
      See README.udtrelay for details.


SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES

  This package aimed to be running on POSIX systems and possibly Win32
  in the future.
  
  By now, it was successfully compiled and ran on the following
  platforms:
	  
    Lunix:
	i686-pc-linux-gnu   (EL3, gcc 3.2.3)	
	x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (EL4, gcc 3.4.6)
	
    FreeBSD:
	i386-pc-freebsd5.2.1
        i386-pc-freebsd6.2
        i386-pc-freebsd6.1

  Please let us know if you compile it on other OS versions and it
  works for you so we can add them to the above list.

  Porting:  Please! read the PORTING file.

  Also note that some architectures may have architecture specific
  README files, so you should check to see if there is one appropriate
  to your platform.
